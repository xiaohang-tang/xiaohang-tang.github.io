## About Me

Hi, I am Xiaohang Tang, a final year undergraduate at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). I am now a member of Natural Language Processing group[(NLP@Liv)](https://livnlp.github.io/), advised by [Danushka Bollegala](http://danushka.net/).

I have worked as a research intern at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), working with [Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) since 2022 summer. Prior to it, I worked as a research assitant at the X-CHI Lab of [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/), with [Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/school-of-advanced-technology/staff/haining-liang) and Diego Monteiro ([ESIEA](https://www.esiea.fr/en/)).
