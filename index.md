## About Me

Hi, I am Xiaohang Tang, a third-year PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), advised by [Yan Chen](https://chensivan.github.io/). I study and develop Human-AI systems to enhance the programming learning experience at scale, via combining techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, and Visualization.   

I received my B.Sc. (First Class Honors) from [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Danushka Bollegala](http://danushka.net/) in the Natural Language Processing group[(NLP@Liv)](https://livnlp.github.io/).

I was a research intern at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in 2022 summer, working with [Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/). Prior to that, I worked as a research assistant at the X-CHI Lab of [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/), with [Hai-Ning Liang](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-regular/hai-ning-liang/) and [Diego Monteiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-monteiro-8352b739/?locale=fr_FR).
